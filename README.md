Octo (WuKongIM-based corporate IM) channel plugin for
[`hermes-agent`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

Connects a hermes-agent gateway to an Octo bot via the WuKongIM binary
WebSocket protocol (ECDH + AES). Supports bot-to-user DMs, group
messaging, threads, `@`-mentions, and voice / video / file attachments.
Hermes buffers text replies and sends one complete final message.

## Compatibility

| hermes-agent | hermes-channel-octo |
|---|---|
| `>=0.14,<0.21` | `0.1.x` |

## Install

The plugin is verified against `hermes-agent==0.20.0`; the lower bound remains
`0.14` for existing installations. Native interactive `send_clarify` cards are
enabled for Hermes `>=0.20.0`. Hermes `0.14`–`0.19` and unknown/unparseable
versions retain Hermes' plain-text clarify fallback.

All commands below assume `HERMES_HOME` points at the hermes install you
want to wire the plugin into, and that you invoke the matching `hermes`
binary from that install's venv:

```bash
export HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes              # adjust to your install
HERMES=$HERMES_HOME/.venv/bin/hermes
PIP=$HERMES_HOME/.venv/bin/pip
```

### Recommended: pip (entry-point discovery)

```bash
# From GitHub:
$PIP install 'git+https://github.com/Mininglamp-OSS/hermes-channel-octo.git'

# From PyPI (once published):
# $PIP install hermes-channel-octo
```

Pip resolves all runtime dependencies automatically (`websockets`,
`aiohttp`, `cryptography`, `python-socks`, `packaging`).

The plugin is registered via Python entry-points and **loads on the
next gateway start** — no `hermes plugins enable` needed. Note that
entry-point plugins do **not** show up in `hermes plugins list` (which
only lists directory-scanned plugins); confirm load via gateway logs
(see *Verify* below).

### Alternative: `hermes plugins install` (bundled clone)

```bash
$HERMES plugins install Mininglamp-OSS/hermes-channel-octo
$HERMES plugins enable octo

# bundled-plugin protocol does NOT install pyproject deps — install manually:
$PIP install 'websockets>=15.0,<16' 'aiohttp>=3.13,<4' \
             'cryptography>=46.0,<49' 'python-socks>=2.8,<3' \
             'packaging>=24,<27'
```

`hermes plugins install` clones into `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/octo/` (the
directory name comes from `plugin.yaml`'s `name:` field, not the repo
name). Bundled plugins are opt-in, so the explicit `enable` step is
required.

Prefer the pip path unless you need the in-tree clone for local hacking.

## Configuration

Set the following in `$HERMES_HOME/.env` (or via `hermes config`):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OCTO_API_URL` | yes | Octo bot API base URL (e.g. `https://api.botgate.cn`) |
| `OCTO_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | Octo bot authentication token |
| `OCTO_CDN_URL` | no | CDN prefix for media acceleration |
| `OCTO_WS_URL` | no | WuKongIM `ws://`/`wss://` override; defaults to the URL returned by bot registration |
| `OCTO_ON_BEHALF_OF` | no | Trusted grantor user ID for server-authorized persona delivery; text, typing, RichText, and media use this identity, while unsupported Type-17 progress/tool cards fall back to plain text |
| `OCTO_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS` | no | Set to `true` only for trusted self-hosted API/CDN origins that resolve to private IPs; metadata endpoints remain blocked |
| `OCTO_ALLOWED_USERS` | no | Comma-separated user IDs allowed to talk to the bot |
| `OCTO_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | no | Allow any user to trigger the bot (dev only) |
| `OCTO_HOME_CHANNEL` | no | Default group/chat ID for cron / notification delivery |
| `OCTO_CARD_MESSAGE_ENABLED` | no | Legacy `1` opt-in only when the server has no card-profile endpoint; an advertised server manifest remains authoritative |
| `OCTO_EVENT_POLL_INTERVAL_S` | no | Minimum event polling interval in seconds (default `2.0`, minimum `0.5`) |
| `OCTO_EVENT_POLL_WAIT_S` | no | Event long-poll hold in seconds (default `25`, `0` disables, capped at `30`) |
| `OCTO_EVENT_POLL_LIMIT` | no | Events requested per batch (default `50`, clamped to `1..100`) |
| `OCTO_PROGRESS_CARD_RENDERER` | no | Progress-card renderer: `local` (default, Chinese Type-17 execution trace) or `registry` (server `ai.reasoning-process` template when advertised, otherwise local fallback) |

## Current-conversation tools

When both required credentials are configured, the plugin registers:

- controlled Type-17 display/interactive send and display-card edit tools;
- controlled RichText text/image delivery;
- image, file, voice, and video delivery.

Card capabilities are negotiated automatically; no card-profile diagnostic is
exposed to the model. These tools derive the destination and requester from
Hermes' task-local Octo session, and their schemas accept no channel or identity
overrides. Outbound local media must first pass the installed Hermes runtime's
native media-delivery authorization, then uses inode/no-symlink and 100 MiB
checks before upload. HTTP(S) media retains the guarded download flow. Native
Hermes media delivery also accepts `data:` URLs.

Interactive card actions are accepted only while the originating in-process
card session remains registered and only when message, channel, operator,
action, binding, and Hermes session identity all match. The event cursor is
persisted before acknowledgement. These paths are covered by local automated
tests; production-server card/action/media interoperability still requires the
separately authorized live acceptance checks.

On Hermes `>=0.20.0`, bounded clarifies with choices use the same trusted
current-conversation route and Type-17 session binding. Native delivery has one
12-second deadline, waits at most 5 seconds for an active progress card's first
send, and rechecks the same pending clarify before every POST. Single-select
prompts render one submit action per choice; multi-select prompts render
`Input.ChoiceSet` plus Submit; both include an **Other** action that switches
the existing clarify to Hermes text capture. Choice clicks call Hermes'
clarify resolution primitive directly and never become a new model turn.
Card/profile/render failures use the base text fallback. Ambiguous POST
failures retry once with the same `client_msg_no` and never send a second
prompt. This version gate is automatic and has no configuration switch.

## Start / Verify

```bash
$HERMES gateway restart
tail -f $HERMES_HOME/logs/gateway.log
```

Successful load looks like:

```
INFO gateway.run: Connecting to octo...
INFO hermes_octo_plugin.adapter: [Octo] Bot registered: robot_id=...
INFO hermes_octo_plugin.adapter: [Octo] Connected (server_version=4)
INFO gateway.run: ✓ octo connected
INFO gateway.run: Gateway running with 1 platform(s)
```

If you see `No messaging platforms enabled`, the plugin did not load.
Common causes:

- pip path: gateway was already running when the package was installed —
  always `gateway restart` after pip install.
- bundled path: forgot `hermes plugins enable octo`, or forgot to install
  the runtime deps listed above.

Direct Bot API envelopes, event formats, and operational curl examples are
documented separately in [`docs/OCTO_BOT_API.md`](docs/OCTO_BOT_API.md); they
are not part of the Agent-facing current-session tool contract.
